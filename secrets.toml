Please be AWARE!!!!!!! Priceline is running shady business practices. I booked a car rental thru them in mid december for new jersey. The car I was promised toyota corolla or something similar. But the car that I recieved was old, manual car which stop working after 3 hrs of driving. Priceline had contracted with this local shady car rental company who refused to provide refund stating that I might have kept the light on. I complained to priceline customer care, three times, every time they said they would contact the rental company and revert in 10 days but they did not do anything. Finally when I escalated , their supervisor said if car rental company is not refunding, there is nothing we can do. so I ended up paying for 3 days of rental when I used the car only for 3 hours with no fault of mine.
